# Radar Semantic Segmentation using CARRADA

Unofficial implementation of the Radar Semantic Segmentation Network (RSS-Net) presented by Kaul et al. in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03451)

The architecture has been slightly changed to match the [CARRADA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01456).

The CARRADA dataset is available on Arthur Ouaknine's personal web page at this link: [https://arthurouaknine.github.io/codeanddata/carrada](https://arthurouaknine.github.io/codeanddata/carrada).
